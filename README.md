TAMUSA LLM-Based Chat Application

A research-oriented Large Language Model (LLM) conversational AI system developed at Texas A&M University–San Antonio (TAMUSA).

This project implements supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a transformer-based language model to support domain-adapted instruction-following and controlled conversational generation. The repository includes training scripts, inference pipelines, configuration files, and deployment-ready components designed for reproducible academic experimentation.
